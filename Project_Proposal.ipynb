This makes it difficult for sommeliers and wine enthusiasts to know which wines to serve and/or purchase. Therefore, the goal of this project is to help address this problem by developing a machine learning model that can predict the quality of white wines based on their objective physicochemical properties, rather than subjective human taste."

The highest model accuracy achieved in the existing solutions is by using SVM with a classification approach — 64.6% for the correct classified class of white wine, with a 86.8% accuracy rate for predicting within one of the two nearest classes.
